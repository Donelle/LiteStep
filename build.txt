How to build.

Download libpng from http://www.libpng.org and place in the \libpng directory (make sure it is libpng and not lpng124 or something else)

Download zlib from http://www.zlib.org and unzip in the \zlib directory

Open the \libpng\projects\msvc\libpng.dsw MS VC++ workspace

Compile the zlib and libpng dll's

LiteStep sources should be in \ls-b247

for instance the directory structure should look something like this

c:\cvs\libpng\
c:\cvs\zlib\
c:\cvs\ls-b247\
