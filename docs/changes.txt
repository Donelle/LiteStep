    LiteStep 0.24.7 Beta 3
    Prerelease Changelog
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-


-- NOTE ------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The 0.24.7 code is based on the 2002-01-03 pre-0.24.6 source. Some of the
 functionality that was added to the 0.24.6 branch after this date (mostly Indie
 LS changes) was reimplemented in 0.24.7. See below for a list of these
 functions and for what is missing.


-- CHANGES SINCE 0.24.6 --------------------------------------------------------

 - Removed all COM.

 - Cleaned up the code... this includes numerous fixes, formatting, and source 
   beautifications.

 - Switched to STLport (http://www.stlport.com) due to threading issues and
   other general issues with the version of STL included with the VC 6.0 package.

 - On NT systems, LiteStep detects if startup items have been run before or not.
   This is the same method that Explorer uses to detect if it should rerun
   startup items in the event that the shell crashes. Thus the -nostartup switch
   is obsolete on NT systems.

 - Merged LiteMAN functionallity (i.e. DDE) into the LiteStep core. It is now
   called DDEService and loaded by default. Liteman.dll should no longer be
   loaded.

 - Added "LSUseSystemDDE". This loads Windows' DDE server instead of the
   DDEService. Results in larger memory usage but "proper" DDE support.
   LSUseSystemDDE takes effect on startup only, not on !recycle.
   Requires shdocvw.dll from IE.

 - Added !HideModules and !ShowModules to hide or show all module windows.

 - If "LSAutoHideModules" is specified LS tries to automatically hide all module
   windows if a full-screen app is detected. Once the full-screen app exits
   !ShowModules is called.

 - LCOpen uses a separate SettingsMap for each file opened with LCOpen. This is
   the thread-safe approach but makes it impossible for modules to use the
   GetRC* APIs to retrieve settings from those files. For example this affects
   Rabidvwm which can no longer read its settings directly from .box files. Put
   the settings into step.rc instead or "include" the .box file(s) as a
   workaround.

 - Added inform-sega's ShellExecute fix for .lnk files. This enables LSExecute()
   to execute .lnk files.

 - Removed support for PixmapPath (use LSImageFolder instead), ThemeFile,
   LSThemeFile, and LSColorBGR.
 
 - Modules are loaded and unloaded asynchronously (at the same time) if
   threaded. This should lead to faster start and recycle times if threading is
   used.

 - All MessageBoxes (including !alert and !confirm) should now always have focus
   and appear ontop of the active window.
 
 - The Recovery Menu cannot be closed permanently with ALT-F4 any more.

 - Improved handling of exceptions in threaded modules.

 - Improved handling of exceptions during !bang execution.

 - Optimized BitmapToRegion, LoadLSImage, LoadLSIcon, BitmapFromIcon.

 - Rewrote the TrayService.

 - etc. etc.


-- TODO UNTIL 0.24.7 RELEASE ---------------------------------------------------

 - The aboutbox will be implemented as a separate DLL exporting a function for
   LiteStep to call. This should give modules like lscp a chance to be more
   integrated with LiteStep.
   
 - Fix the managers so that they are thread safe and accessible by the aboutbox.

 - Complete -install/-uninstall updates, which will include a new wizards
   interface.
   
 - Make sure CListeStep::Start frees all allocated resources on failure before
   returning.

 - Fix LS locking up if a PNG is used and libpng13.dll is not present.

 - Fix modules being hidden if BSPlayer is in desktop mode or if certain
   installers (e.g. ObjectDock) are used.

 - Finish build.txt.

 - Merge this file and readme.txt.


-- INDIE LS CHANGES ADDED TO 0.24.7 --------------------------------------------

 - GetRCCoordinate and ParseCoordinate added to lsapi for reading coordinates
   with negative and centered support.

 - Some typos in the string tables were corrected.

 - $windir$ is guaranteed to end with a backslash ('\').

 - Math evaluation in VarExpansion (can be disabled at compiletime).

 - Stubs in lsapi for the logging APIs (minimal logging support can be enabled
   at compiletime) and for the Get-/SetVariable APIs.

 - Addition of $WinXP$, $compiledate$, and $quicklaunch$.


-- INDIE LS CHANGES NOT (YET) ADDED TO 0.24.7 ----------------------------------

 - All changes made to the recovery menu.

 - !setvar, !emptytrashbin

 - system color / font variables, OS-* variables.

 - LSCP (including !lscp)

 - Removal of !ToggleWharf and !Popup from lsapi.

 - inform-sega's multibyte character fix as it shouldn't be needed any more.

 - c0atzin's RegisterShellHook() fix as it's supposedly not needed any more.
