    LiteStep 0.24.7 Beta 2
    Prerelease Changelog
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-


-- NOTE ------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The 0.24.7 code is based on the 2002-01-03 pre-0.24.6 source. Some of the
 functionality that was added to the 0.24.6 branch after this date was
 reimplemented in 0.24.7. See below for a list of these functions.


-- CHANGES SINCE 0.24.6 --------------------------------------------------------

 - Removed all COM.

 - Cleaned up the code... this includes numerous fixes, formatting, and source 
   beautifications.

 - Switched to STLport (http://www.stlport.com) due to threading issues and
   other general issues with the version of STL included with the VC 6.0 package.

 - On NT systems, LiteStep detects if startup items have been run before or not.
   This is the same method that Explorer uses to detect if it should rerun
   startup items in the event that the shell crashes. Thus the -nostartup switch
   is obsolete on NT systems.

 - Merged LiteMAN functionallity (i.e. DDE) into the LiteStep core.

 - Modules are loaded and unloaded asynchronously (at the same time) if threaded.
   This should lead to faster start and recycle times if threading is used.

 - Removed support for PixmapPath (use LSImageFolder instead), ThemeFile,
   LSThemeFile, and LSColorBGR.
 
 - Both the !alert and the !confirm MessageBoxes should now always have focus
   and appear ontop of the active window.
 
 - The Recovery Menu cannot be closed permanently with ALT-F4 any more.
 
 - Added !HideModules and !ShowModules to hide or show all module windows.

 - If a full-screen app is detected all module windows will be hidden
   automatically using !HideModules. Once the full-screen app exits !ShowModules
   is called. This behavior can be disabled by specifying "LSNoAutoHideModules"
   in step.rc.

 - Optimized BitmapToRegion, LoadLSImage, LoadLSIcon, BitmapFromIcon.

 - etc. etc.


-- TODO UNTIL 0.24.7 RELEASE ---------------------------------------------------

 - The aboutbox will be implemented as a separate DLL exporting a function for
   LiteStep to call. This should give modules like lscp a chance to be more
   integrated with LiteStep.
   
 - Fix the managers so that they are thread safe and accessible by the aboutbox.

 - Fix deadlock in BangManager (esp. on !recycle).

 - Complete -install/-uninstall updates, which will include a new wizards
   interface.
   
 - Check DDEWorker.cpp for Path* related bugs.

 - Make sure CListeStep::Start frees all allocated resources on failure before
   returning.

 - Fix LS locking up if a PNG is used and libpng13.dll is not present.

 - Fix modules being hidden if BSPlayer is in desktop mode or if certain
   installers (e.g. ObjectDock) are used.

 - Finish build.txt.

 - Merge this file and readme.txt.


-- INDIE LS CHANGES ADDED TO 0.24.7 --------------------------------------------

 - GetRCCoordinate and ParseCoordinate added to lsapi for reading coordinates
   with negative and centered support.

 - Some typos in the string tables were corrected.

 - $windir$ is guaranteed to end with a backslash ('\').

 - Math evaluation in VarExpansion (can be disabled at compiletime).

 - Stubs in lsapi for the logging APIs (minimal logging support can be enabled
   at compiletime).

 - $WinXP$, $compiledate$.


-- INDIE LS CHANGES NOT (YET) ADDED TO 0.24.7 ----------------------------------

 - All changes made to the recovery menu.

 - !setvar, !emptytrashbin

 - $quicklaunch$, system color / font variables, OS-* variables.

 - LSCP (including !lscp)

 - Removal of !ToggleWharf and !Popup from lsapi.

 - inform-sega's multibyte character fix as it shouldn't be needed any more.

 - c0atzin's RegisterShellHook() fix as it's supposedly not needed any more.
