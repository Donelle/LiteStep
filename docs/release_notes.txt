-- ABOUT -----------------------------------------------------------------------

 LiteStep is a replacement shell for the standard Windows® Explorer shell.

 The Explorer shell provides the familiar desktop environment, start menu, and
 task bar.  The developers of LiteStep (and thousands of users) have found the
 Explorer shell to be static, cumbersome and otherwise too ugly to use.  Thus
 exists LiteStep.

 LiteStep replaces that environment in just about any way that you might find
 useful (and eye catching).  LiteStep provides the way to make your desktop
 interface unique, enjoyable and dynamic.  The desktop environments that the
 LiteStep users create range from a blank screen full of functionality based on
 hotkeys and hotspots, to eye pleasing morphing menus and sliding toolbars
 filled with graphical and informative displays of system status, the latest
 news headlines and the current weather report.

-- SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS ---------------------------------------------------------
 
 LiteStep requires only that you are running a 32bit version of Windows:
 Windows 95, Windows 98(se), Windows ME, Windows 2000, Windows XP

 LiteStep is designed to consume less resources than the Explorer shell which it
 replaces; so there are no system requirements above and beyond that which is
 needed for a normal Windows-based system.

 However, depending on what modules (add-ons) are loaded, any given desktop
 environment will have its own system requirements.  This may range from being
 only compatible with Win2K/XP or requiring a 3d accelerated graphics card. Be
 sure to read the accompanying documentation for any theme or module that you
 choose to install.
 
-- INSTALL ---------------------------------------------------------------------

 NOTE:
 -----
 You are about to install a replacement shell for Windows.  A shell is not a
 normal application; it runs as a special system process.  Replacing the shell
 is not a supported procedure by Microsoft®, and as such, it is possible  that if
 you do something wrong, you may end up with a non functional desktop and/ or
 your system may display an error message asking you to re-install Windows.  Do
 NOT panic, a very simple solution will put you back to where you need to be, so
 that you can fix whatever mistake you made, and try again.  Please read the
 documentation on this topic that came with your LiteStep distribution, or
 review the "Manual Install" steps below.

 Now that you are ready to get going, there are a couple of methods to start
 using LiteStep.

 (see also: http://wiki.litestep.com/LiteStep:Installation)
 
 You MUST have administrative access to install Litestep.

 A) LiteStep Distributions (Recommended and automated)
 -----------------------------------------------------

 The recommended way to start with LiteStep is to install one of the community
 driven LiteStep distributions.  Typically these distributions come with a
 friendly step by step installation wizard that will set your system up using a
 default desktop environment and theme.  Currently we recommend using the very
 successful distribution by Omar which uses the Open Theme Standard 2 (OTS2).

 Please read the installation guide on his website before installing:

 http://beyondconvention.net/ohussain/lsinstaller/

 B) LiteStep From Scratch (Manual install and configuration)
 -----------------------------------------------------------

 STOP: If you are NOT highly familiar with editing the registry or reading
       lots of documentation and editing text configuration files, then this
       procedure is NOT for you!  Please use a LiteStep Distribution. Thank you.

 For the do-it-yourself type, please thoroughly read the following before
 proceeding.  It will save you a lot of headache.  I promise.
 
 Create a folder for LiteStep.  Generally this is done at "C:\LiteStep".

 Extract the contents of "LS-0.24.7u.zip" to this folder.  Once the contents are
 extracted, there should be a file located at "C:\LiteStep\litestep.exe".
 
 Create a text file named "step.rc" and place it in the same folder as
 "litestep.exe".  Using the previous example location, this empty text file
 should now be at "C:\LiteStep\step.rc".
 
 Next, consult the section "HELP" to configure LiteStep via the step.rc text
 file.  Do NOT set LiteStep as your shell until you have configured it,
 otherwise you will be left with a disfunctional (yet recoverable) system.
 
 To set LiteStep as your shell, follow these instructions:
 
  1. Win9x/ME

    - Using a text editor (e.g. Notepad) open the Windows System file named
      "system.ini". This file's location is normally "C:\Windows\system.ini"

    - Locate the line that begins with "shell=".  This line is located in the
      "[boot]" section.  Typically the full line looks like "shell=explorer.exe"
      (without quotation marks).  Comment out this line (which disables it) by
      placing a semi-colon at the begining of the line.  The line should now
      look like ";shell=explorer.exe" (without the quotation marks).
      
    - Create a new "shell=" line in the same location as the one removed. This
      new line should contain the location of "litestep.exe". For example it
      might look like "shell=C:\LiteStep\litestep.exe" (without the quotation
      marks).

    - Reboot your system.
    
    - README! When you reboot, if you get the error:

      "CANNOT FIND <shell file name> PLEASE REINSTALL WINDOWS"

      Do NOT reinstall windows!  Just simply follow the instructions below to
      put your shell back to the default:

      Boot into DOS (press F8 before Windows starts, or use a DOS boot disk).
      Issue the command "edit C:\Windows\system.ini" adjusting for the location
      of your system.ini file.  Delete the new line you created in the previous
      steps, and uncomment the line you previously disabled. Do this by deleting
      the semicolon at the start of the line.  You should now have one line that
      starts with "shell=" in the "[boot]" section of the "system.ini" file,
      "shell=explorer.exe".  Save the file and reboot your system.

  2. Win2K/XP
  
    - Note: Please see the LiteStep Wiki for a "Group Policy" installation.

    - Note: If you are NOT an administrator, you will most likely NOT be able to
      set LiteStep as your shell.  The only exception to this is if your System
      Administrator has enabled "per user" shells.  This is highly unlikely.

      While it is "possible" to run LiteStep at the same time as the default
      Explorer shell, it is discouraged and completely unsupported. Good luck!

    - Open "regedit" or a similiar utility.

    - To ENABLE "per user" shells:
      * Locate the following key:

        HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion
          \IniFileMapping\system.ini\boot

      * Change the string value named "Shell" to:

        USR:Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon

    - To DISABLE "per user" shells:
      * Locate the following key:

        HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion
          \IniFileMapping\system.ini\boot

      * Change the string value named "Shell" to:

        SYS:Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon

    - To set the DEFAULT system shell:
      * Locate the following key:

        HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon

      * Change the string value named "Shell" to the location of the file you
        want to use as your default system shell.

        For LiteStep use (adjust path as necessary):
        
          C:\LiteStep\litestep.exe
        
        For Explorer use (do not specify a path):
        
          Explorer.exe
        
    - To set the shell for the currently logged in user:
      * Locate the following key:

        HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon

      * Change the string value named "Shell" to the location of the file you
        want to use as your current user shell.

        For LiteStep use (adjust path as necessary):

          C:\LiteStep\litestep.exe

        For Explorer use (do not specify a path):

          Explorer.exe

    - To use any shell besides Explorer, the following keys MUST be changed.
      If you do not configure these keys, you will not be able to use the
      Explorer File Manager.

      * Locate the following key:

        HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer

      * Change (create) the DWORD value named "DesktopProcess" to a value of 1.

      * Locate the following key:
      
        HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion
          \Explorer\Advanced

      * Change (create) the DWORD value named "DesktopProcess" to a value of 1.

    - If you changed the "per user" shell setting, you MUST reboot.  Otherwise
      simply log off.  When you return to the desktop, LiteStep will be running
      as your shell if you managed to configure everything correctly.

    - If you end up with a blank or otherwise non-functional desktop.  Press
      CTRL+SHIFT+ESC key combination.  The Windows Task Manager will open. Use
      the File menu to Run a New Task.  Launch your registry editor and use the
      previous instructions to set your system shell back to the default
      Explorer shell.

-- USAGE (HELP) ----------------------------------------------------------------

 The following section lays out the structure of LiteStep, and the available
 configuration options.

 A) LiteStep Structure
 ---------------------
 
 LiteStep is designed around a modular plugin system.  The LiteStep "core" by
 itself is rather useless to you until you configure and load a plugin.  These
 plugins are called "Modules" and are available from several LiteStep community
 websites (See the ABOUT section).

 Modules

 B) Command Line Parameters
 --------------------------
 
 Litestep has several command line switches to perform various actions.
 
  -nostartup
  ----------

   Description:
    Disables running Windows startup items when loading LiteStep.

    This is useful on Windows 95, Windows 98(se) and Windows ME if you need to
    restart LiteStep.

    On Windows 2000 and Windows XP this switch is not needed as startup items
    are ran only once per session.

   Usage:
    litestep.exe -nostartup

  -startup
  --------
  
   Description:
    Force running Windows startup items when loading LiteStep.

    On Windows 2000 and Windows XP, startup items are run only once per session.
    Using this switch overrides that behavior and forces startup item execution.

    This is not useful on Windows 95/98(se)/ME as startup items are always ran.
    
   Usage:
    litestep.exe -startup
    
  !<bang command>
  ---------------

   Description:
    Executes the specified !bang command.

   Usage:
    litestep.exe !recycle
    
    litestep.exe !ReloadModule "C:\LiteStep\Mmodules\popup.dll"

 C) Step.rc Syntax

-- HISTORY ---------------------------------------------------------------------

In December of 1997 Francis Gastellu released the first private build (v1.0 ß1)
of what was originally named SimpleStep, a shell replacement for Windows95.
Over the next month several more builds were released, and the project was
renamed to LiteSTEP, and described as LiteSTEP "will give your windows the
AfterSTEP look&feel."

Between 12/14/97 and 05/06/98, Francis released >23 Beta builds of LiteSTEP v1.0
with the final release of LiteSTEP 1.0 ß23d on 05/06/98.  He subsequently opened
the Borland C Builder 1.0 source code under the GNU GPL (General Public License)
and handed the development over to Brandon Williams (Floach) and what became the
Litestep Development Team.

And while the source was released under the GPL, it came with the following text
stipulating his desires to see LiteSTEP development continue fork free:

   Please, do not distribute modified versions on your own or we will end up
   with a big mess.

   If you have made modifications that you would like to see in the released
   package, contact the Litestep project coordinator and submit your work.

   You may also join the Litestep development team, we welcome everybody
   who is motivated.

On 07/20/98 the new Litestep Development Team released their first build of
LiteSTEP v1.0 ß23e with the help of Francis.

On 10/27/98 the Litestep Development Team released "LiteStep Version 0.24.0"
based on their source tree re-written in plain C using Visual Studio 5 & 6. The
new source supported modular add-ons allowing 3rd party developers to contribute
to LiteStep's features.  The release included a complete installer with a
packaged theme.  Fahim then joined the team and they released three "upgrade"
builds:

0.24.2 (10-30-98)
0.24.3 (11-06-98)
0.24.4 (11-28-98)

At this point it was decided the code needed to be cleaned up significantly
and several new developers were brought on from the module developer community
with the focus to clean up the supported modules and core.

On 08/29/99 the team released version 0.24.5 with a new installer and theme.
Subsequently development continued for three months until Fahim quit and the
Litestep Development Team lead was given to newcomer, Headius.  NeXTer and
Message also joined the team at that time.  As development progressed and was
taken in new directions, jugg, Ender and Visigoth decided to leave the team as
well.  The last stable release built off of the 0.24.5 code base was dubbed the
"1999-11-23" build.

Under the guide of Headius, LiteStep progressed as a C++/COM implementation
and found many new features and improvements for themers.  Over the following
year until early 2001, the team released many intermediate builds on their goal
for a stable 0.24.6 release.  Unfortunately because of a decision to proceed
with a major rewrite of the shell's internals, a formal version 0.24.6 was never
released, even though development continued on the 0.24.6 branch until
2002-02-16.  As the rewrite (with a goal of being version 0.25.0) continued, the
community stagnated from the lack of formal releases.

In response to this situation, a group of independant developers formed what
they named "IndieStep" to continue the 0.24.6 code base while they waited for
the formal 0.25.0 development to finalize.  Again unfortunately the development
of 0.25.0 was abandoned due to varying circumstances, and the majority of the
then current development team quit, leaving LiteStep dead in the water accept
for the continuing IndieStep development.

At this point the Litestep Development Team lead was given to Message, and he
announced work on LiteStep 0.24.7 which would return the LiteStep code base back
to stream-lined C++ implementation without COM.  So, again over the following
year as Message cleaned up the source code and fixed numerous issues, IndieStep
continued development waiting for a 0.24.7 release.

However, Message was deployed to Iraq, and was unable to continue his work on
0.24.7.  So, The Litestep Development Team's lead once more changed, and Message
gave it to Ilmcuts from the IndieStep effort.  Ilmcuts quickly progressed the
code base and released the first beta build of 0.24.7 on March 13, 2003.  By
May 21, 2004, he had the third release candidate of 0.24.7 ready.

Now the Litestep Development Team proudly presents "LiteStep 0.24.7" on the 8th
anniversary of this shell that will forever change the way you interact with
your Windows desktop.
