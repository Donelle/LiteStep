-- ABOUT -----------------------------------------------------------------------

 Litestep is a replacement shell for the standard Windows(tm) Explorer shell.

 The Explorer shell provides the familiar desktop environment, start menu, and
 task bar.  The developers of Litestep (and thousands of users) have found the
 Explorer shell to be static, cumbersome and otherwise too ugly to use.  Thus
 exists Litestep.

 Litestep replaces that environment in just about any way that you might find
 useful (and eye catching).  Litestep provides the way to make your desktop
 interface unique, enjoyable and dynamic.  The desktop environments that the
 Litestep users create range from a blank screen full of functionality based on
 hotkeys and hotspots, to eye pleasing morphing menus and sliding toolbars
 filled with graphical and informative displays of system status, the latest
 news headlines and the current weather report.

-- SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS ---------------------------------------------------------
 
 Litestep requires only that you are running a 32bit version of Windows:
 Win95, Win98(se), WinME, Win2K, WinXP

 Litestep is designed to consume less resources than the Explorer shell it
 replaces, so there are no system requirements above and beyond that which is
 needed for a normal Windows system.

 However, depending on what modules (add-ons) are loaded, any given desktop
 environment will have its own system requirements.  This may range from being
 only compatible with Win2K/XP or requiring a 3d accelerated graphics card. Be
 sure to read the accompanying documentation for any theme or module that you
 choose to install.
 
-- INSTALL ---------------------------------------------------------------------

 NOTE:
 -----
 You are about to install a replacment shell for Windows.  A shell is not a
 normal application, and runs as a special system process.  Replacing the shell
 is not a supported procedure by Microsoft, and as such, it is possible  that if
 you do something wrong, you may end up with a non functional desktop or your
 system may display an error message asking you to re-install Windows.  Do NOT
 panic, a very simple solution will put you back to where you need to be, so you
 can fix whatever mistake you made, and try again.  Please read the
 documentation on this topic that came with your Litestep distribution, or
 review the "Manual Install" steps below.

 Now that you are ready to get going, there are several methods to start using
 Litestep.

 (see also: http://wiki.litestep.com/LiteStep:Installation)

 A. Litestep Distributions (Recommended and automated)
 -----------------------------------------------------

 The recommended way is to install one of the community driven Litestep
 distributions.  Typically these distributions come with a friendly step by step
 installation wizard that will set your system up using a default desktop
 environment and theme.  Currently we recommend using the very successful
 distribution by Omar which utilizes the Open Theme Standard 2 (OTS2).

 Please read the installation guide on his website before downloading:

 B. Litestep From Scratch (Manual install and configuration)
 -----------------------------------------------------------

 For the do-it-yourself type, please thoroughly read the following before
 proceeding.  It will save you a lot of headache.  I promise.

-- HISTORY ---------------------------------------------------------------------

In December of 1997 Francis Gastellu released the first private build (v1.0 ß1)
of what was originally named SimpleStep, a shell replacement for Windows95.
Over the next month several more builds were released, and the project was
renamed to LiteSTEP, and described as "[LiteSTEP] ... will give your windows the
AfterSTEP look&feel."

Between 12/14/97 and 05/06/98, Francis released >23 Beta builds of LiteSTEP v1.0
with the final release of LiteSTEP 1.0 ß23d on 05/06/98.  He subsequently opened
the source code under the GNU GPL (General Public License) and handed the
development over to Brandon Williams (Floach) and what became the Litestep
Development Team.

And while the source was released under the GPL, it came with the following text
stipulating his desires to see LiteSTEP development continue unfragmented:

   Please, do not distribute modified versions on your own or we will end up
   with a big mess.

   If you have made modifications that you would like to see in the released
   package, contact the Litestep project coordinator and submit your work.

   You may also join the Litestep development team, we welcome everybody
   who is motivated.

On 07/20/98 the new Litestep Development Team released their first build of
LiteSTEP v1.0 ß23e with the help of Francis.

On 10/27/98 the Litestep Development Team released "LiteStep Version 0.24.0"
based on their updated source tree supporting modular add-ons.  The release
included a complete installer with a packaged theme.  Fahim then joined the
team and they released three "upgrade" builds:

0.24.2 (1998-10-30)
0.24.3 (1998-11-06)
0.24.4 (1998-11-28)

At this point it was decided the code needed to be cleaned up significantly
and several new developers were brought on from the module developer community
with the focus to clean up the supported modules and core.

On 08/29/99 the team released version 0.24.5 with a new installer and theme.
Subsequently development continued for three months until Fahim quit and the
Litestep Development Team lead was given to newcomer, Headius.  NeXTer and
Message also joined the team at that time.  As development progressed and was
taken in new directions, jugg, Ender and Visigoth decided to leave the team as
well.  The last stable release built off of the 0.24.5 code base was dubbed the
"1999-11-23" build.

Under the guide of Headius, Litestep progressed as a C++/COM implementation
and found many new features and improvements for themers.  Over the following
year until early 2001, the team released many intermediate builds on their goal
for a stable 0.24.6 release.  Unfortunately because of a decision to proceed
with a major rewrite of the shell's internals, a formal version 0.24.6 was never
released, although development continued on the 0.24.6 branch until 2002-02-16.
As the rewrite (with a goal of being version 0.25.0) continued, the community
stagnated from the lack of releases formal releases.

In answer to this situation, a group of independant developers formed what they
named "IndieStep" to continue the 0.24.6 code base while they waited for the
formal 0.25.0 development to finalize.  Again unfortuenatly the development of
0.25.0 was abandoned due to varying circumstances and the majority of the then
current development team quit, leaving Litestep dead in the water accept for
the continuing IndieStep development.

At this point, Message stepped up to the plate and took lead of the Litestep
Development Team, and announced work on Litestep 0.24.7 which would return
the Litestep code base back to stream-lined C++ implementation without COM.  So,
again over the following year as Message cleaned up the source code and fixed
numerous issues, IndieStep continued development waiting for a 0.24.7 release.

However, Message was deployed to Iraq, and was unable to continue his work on
0.24.7.  Ilmcuts from the IndieStep effort was able to take over, and was able
to release the first beta build of 0.24.7 on March 13, 2003.  By May 21, 2004,
he had release candidate 3 of 0.24.7 ready.

Since then, nothing has happened until _now_.

Now the Litestep Development Team proudly presents "Litestep 0.24.7" on the 8th
aniversry of this shell that will forever change the way you interact with your
Windows desktop.
