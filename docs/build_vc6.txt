    LiteStep 0.24.7
    Visual C++ 6.0 Developer Information
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-


-- BUILD REQUIREMENTS ----------------------------------------------------------

 - Visual C++ 6.0 with Service Pack 6 (www.microsoft.com)
 - Microsoft Platform SDK February 2003 Edition (www.microsoft.com)
 - libpng 1.2.8 (www.libpng.org)
 - zlib 1.2.3 (www.zlib.net)

 This is the configuration used during 0.24.7 development, it is quite possible
 that other versions of the above packages can be used, but there's no
 guarantee.


-- BUILD SETUP -----------------------------------------------------------------

 It is assumed that Visual C++ 6 and Service Pack 6 are already installed. If
 you don't have Service Pack 6 get it here:

 http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/downloads/updates/sp/vs6/sp6/default.aspx

 A. Install The Platform SDK
 ---------------------------

  1. Unfortunately the last version of the Platform SDK that is compatible with
     Visual C++ 6 is no longer available for download.  You may order a free
     copy (plus shipping) from:

     https://www.qdirect.net/qmsfp/Product5.aspx?Item=1748

     We apologize for this.  We have started testing build files for both MinGW
     (www.mingw.org) and Visual C++ 2003 which is compatible with current
     Platform SDK versions.  However, neither build environment is currently
     supported and all 0.24.x binary releases will be made with Visual C++ 6.

     You may download the latest Platform SDK from:

     http://www.microsoft.com/msdownload/platformsdk/sdkupdate/

  2. Make sure MSVC is closed, then install the Platform SDK. The Platform SDK
     will create an entry in your start menu. In there you'll find a sub-entry
     named "Visual Studio Registration". Click on the "Register PSDK
     Directories with Visual Studio" item.

  3. Verify that the Platform SDK registered correctly with Visual C++.

    - Open MSVC and go to the "Tools" menu and click "Options".

    - Choose the "Directories" tab.

    - Verify that the Platform SDK folders are present for "Executable files",
      "Include files" and "Library files".

    - Verify that the Platform SDK folders are the first one(s) listed in each
      list.

 B. Install libpng and zlib
 --------------------------

  Note: The following instructions explain how to build the libpng and zlib
        libraries from source code.  However, all you need to build the LiteStep
        source code are the files libpng13.lib, png.h, pngconf.h, zlib.h and
        zconf.h placed in your LIB and INCLUDE paths respectively. LiteStep
        links against libpng13.lib (for debug builds libpng13d.lib) and only
        includes png.h.

  1. Go to http://www.libpng.org/ and http://www.zlib.net/ and download the
     respective source code (libpng-1.2.8-src.zip and zlib123.zip).

  2. Extract the archives to two directories "libpng" and "zlib" in the same
     parent directory the LiteStep source resides in (make sure you extract zlib
     to "zlib" and not "zlib-1.2.3" or something else). For instance the
     directory structure could look like this:

      c:\dev\libpng
      c:\dev\LiteStep
      c:\dev\zlib

  3. Open the \libpng\projects\visualc6\libpng.dsw workspace file in MSVC.

  4. In the "Build" menu select "Set Active Configuration" and choose
     "libpng - Win32 DLL".

  5. Select "Rebuild All" in the "Build" menu to start compiling.

  6. Repeat steps 4 and 5 for the "libpng - Win32 DLL Debug" configuration.

  7. Update the Visual C++ build Directory listings.

    - Add the <path-to-libpng> folder to the "Include files" Directory list.

    - Add the <path-to-zlib> folder to the "Include files" Directory list.

    - Add the <path-to-libpng>\projects\visualc6\Win32_DLL_Release path to the
      "Library files" Directory list.

    - Add the <path-to-libpng>\projects\visualc6\Win32_DLL_Debug path to the
      "Library files" Directory list.


-- BUILDING LITESTEP -----------------------------------------------------------

 A. Extract source code
 ----------------------

  1. Create a build directory for the source code (LiteStep, for example).

  2. Extract the source code into the build directory. So that the build
     directory has the following structure:

     \LiteStep
         \litestep
         \lsapi
         \utility

 B. Compile
 ----------

  1. Open the \litestep.dsw workspace file in MSVC.

  2. In the "Build" menu select "Set Active Configuration" and choose the
     desired build type of the litestep project.

  3. Select "Rebuild All" in the "Build" menu to start compiling.

  4. The output directory is a subdirectory of \LiteStep\litestep, depending on
     your build choice (Debug or Release).
